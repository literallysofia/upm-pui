<!-- ADVICE FOR PEPI
    images MUST be responsive, never assign a fixed value to them (like 50%), because then in mobile they will be tiny.
    always test the design in mobile/tablet
    there is a thing called image fluid in bootstrap
    also, dont change existing css without knowing what its effect, p.e .card .badge
    i would advice to put everything in a flex box column (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/flex/)
    so you should add the other classes of bootstrap next to "article" in the first div
    hint: the class align-items-start is very important as well
    if the image ends up being too big, you can define in the css a max-width (never in px, use em instead)
    don't forget that the html displayed in body/abstract should be properly shown
    the img is optional in articles, no you only show it IF the article.image_data is not an empty string / exists (test it with different articles)
    The modification date and the username who have modified the content must be shown at the end of the page. (username is missing, check the service)

<div class="article">
    <h2>{{article.title}}</h2>
    <h6>{{article.subtitle}}</h6>
    <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">{{article.category}}</span>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,{{article.image_data}}" alt="{{article.title}}" class="img-fluid">
    <p>{{article.abstract}}</p>
    <p>{{article.body}}</p>
    <small class="align-self-end">Updated on {{article.update_date}}</small>
</div>
